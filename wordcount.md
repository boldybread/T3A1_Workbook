## Q2 What are the most important aspects of quality software?

To create a high quality application there are several characteristics that are important to aim for to make sure we are delivering robust code to a high standard resulting in a great product and user experience.

### Reliability

Reliability is how well software can run effectively over a period of time without experiencing bugs or degradation of any kind. Effective code should be both predictable and reliable so that the code produces expected results without producing errors or crashing. Thorough testing allows us to ensure reliability.

### Maintainability

Maintainability is the ease at which software and its code can be maintained during its period of use, it needs to be both functional and supportable over time. This becomes harder and more complex as the code size increases as well as the code increasing in complexity or decreasing in consistency. Maintainability needs to be assessed by automated testing as well as human reviewers therefore it is vital that the code is testable and easy to understand. The more modular code has been written the easier it is to separate and change things without affecting or breaking the rest of the code.

### Testability

Which brings us on to testability which is how testable code is. We need to be able to write automated tests that verify our code is producing expected results without crashing or producing errors. Testing should be an integral part of our development process and should ensure that any issues or potential issues can be quickly identified and rectified.

### Portability

Portability refers to how easily or well the software can be used in different enviroments such as on different platforms etc. Portability can be hard to measure but we can ensure portable code by testing on different platforms throughout the development cycle, rather than waiting until the end of development. Coding standards help with portability.

### Reusability

Reusability is how easily reused the existing code is. If we write code with properly defined interfaces it can be reused in future projects or features. Again modularity in code makes is a preferred practice as this also makes your code more reusable.

### Security

Security even though I have listed it last is potentially the most important aspect of quality software, in this day and age there is more vulnerabilioties than ever so ensuring our users have protected data is critical. Secure coding practices are essential to avoid data breaches and unauthorised access.
